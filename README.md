# TASK 2 - Automated Report Generation using Python

The objective of this task is to design and develop an automated report generation system using Python programming that reads data from a structured file (such as CSV), performs basic data analysis, and generates a well-formatted PDF report using libraries such as ReportLab or FPDF. This task aims to simulate real-world reporting systems used in business analytics, data science, and automation processes where data must be quickly analyzed and presented in a readable, professional format without manual intervention.

In today’s data-driven world, organizations often deal with large volumes of raw data. Manually analyzing such data and creating reports is time-consuming and error-prone. This task addresses that challenge by automating the entire process—from reading the data to generating a final report—thereby saving time, improving accuracy, and enhancing productivity.

The core objective of this project is to build a script that can be reused across multiple datasets with minimal changes. The script should:
	1.	Read structured data from a file (preferably a CSV).
	2.	Analyze the dataset, computing summary statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and percentiles.
	3.	Format this analysis into a structured layout suitable for reporting.
	4.	Generate a final report in PDF format using Python’s PDF generation libraries.

The task uses Python libraries like:
	•	pandas for data manipulation and statistical analysis,
	•	reportlab (or alternatively fpdf) for generating PDF reports.

The significance of using pandas lies in its powerful and efficient data-handling capabilities. It enables easy reading, cleaning, and analysis of tabular data. On the other hand, reportlab offers extensive tools for creating customized PDF layouts, including text formatting, positioning, and graphical representation.

From an academic and professional learning perspective, this task develops critical skills in:
	•	File handling and data preprocessing,
	•	Exploratory data analysis (EDA),
	•	Report automation using Python,
	•	Working with third-party Python libraries,
	•	Producing readable and formal output formats (PDFs).

The deliverables of the task include:
	•	A well-documented Python script (.py) file that performs all the required steps.
	•	A sample CSV data file used for input.
	•	A generated PDF file that serves as the final report, summarizing the input data.

Moreover, this task prepares students and professionals to deal with real-world scenarios where automated reporting is essential. For example, in business analytics, monthly sales reports can be auto-generated using similar scripts. In academic institutions, student performance reports can be produced from examination data. Healthcare applications can generate patient test summaries. The use cases are vast and valuable.

In conclusion, the Automated Report Generation task combines data analysis and document automation to create a robust solution for repetitive, data-centric reporting needs. It leverages the power of Python to streamline processes, reduce manual effort, and deliver consistent and accurate results. The task not only strengthens programming and data handling skills but also enhances understanding of automation practices that are widely used in the tech industry.
